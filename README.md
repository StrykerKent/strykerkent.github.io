# Stryker Stinnette's Portfolio Website

This is a repo of my personal portfolio website ([Stryk3r.com](http://www.stryk3r.com)). Originally built in PHP. Now adapted to run in GitHub Pages.

Check out [my other github projects](https://github.com/StrykerKent?tab=repositories) or [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/strykers) for more information on me and my work.
